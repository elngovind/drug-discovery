### Day 4: Final Polish (Joint Work)

#### Shared Tasks
- [ ] **Task 17**: Mobile optimization and international drug names
- [ ] **Task 21**: Demo data and presentation materials

## Dependencies & Handoffs

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Task 2 → Task 9**: Drug search API must be ready before frontend search component
2. **Task 3 → Task 10**: Interaction engine must be complete before real-time checking
3. **Task 6 → Task 9-12**: API endpoints needed for all frontend features
4. **Task 8 → Task 3**: Database must be populated before interaction testing

### Integration Points
- **End of Day 1**: API contracts defined and documented
- **Midday Day 2**: Basic APIs deployed for frontend testing
- **End of Day 2**: Core backend functionality complete
- **Midday Day 3**: Frontend components integrated with APIs
- **End of Day 3**: AI features integrated and tested

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Check-ins
- **Morning**: Share today's goals and any blockers
- **Midday**: Quick progress update and dependency check
- **Evening**: Demo what was completed, plan next day

### Immediate Communication Needed For:
- API contract changes
- Database schema modifications
- Major architectural decisions
- Blocking issues or errors
- Timeline concerns

## Recommended Development Order

### Govind (Backend)
1. Start with Task 2 (Drug database) - Foundation for everything
2. Move to Task 3 (Interaction engine) - Core business logic
3. Implement Task 6 (API endpoints) - Enable frontend development
4. Continue with Tasks 4, 5, 7, 8 in parallel
5. Focus on Tasks 13-16 for production readiness

### Ermanno (Frontend)
1. Set up React project structure and basic components
2. Create mock data for development while APIs are being built
3. Implement Task 9 (Basic UI) with mock data
4. Integrate with real APIs as they become available
5. Focus on Tasks 10-12 for core functionality
6. Add AI features (Tasks 18-20) once backend is stable

## Success Criteria

### By End of Day 2
- [ ] All core APIs functional and tested
- [ ] Basic frontend components working with mock data
- [ ] Database populated with test data
- [ ] Integration between frontend and backend started

### By End of Day 3
- [ ] Complete drug interaction checking workflow
- [ ] AI explanations generating properly
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design implemented
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered

### By End of Day 4
- [ ] Polished demo ready
- [ ] All features working end-to-end
- [ ] Presentation materials prepared
- [ ] Code documented and clean

**Next Steps for Team Setup:**
1. Ermanno clones the repository
2. Both team members create their feature branches
3. Set up development environments
4. Begin parallel development on assigned tasks
