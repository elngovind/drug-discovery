- 95% of these interactions are preventable with proper screening
- Healthcare providers lack accessible, comprehensive interaction checking tools
- Patients need clear information about medication risks and side effects
- Global healthcare systems require cost-effective safety solutions

## Solution Vision

A free, accurate, and globally accessible platform that:
- Provides instant drug interaction warnings with severity classifications
- Offers comprehensive short-term and long-term side effect information
- Suggests safer alternative medications when interactions are detected
- Supports healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients worldwide
- Operates both online and offline for resource-limited settings

## Target Users

1. **Healthcare Providers** - Doctors, nurses, and clinicians
2. **Pharmacists** - Community and hospital pharmacists
3. **Patients and Caregivers** - Individuals managing multiple medications
4. **Healthcare System Administrators** - EHR integration teams
5. **Mobile App Developers** - Building medication management apps
6. **Global Health Workers** - Operating in resource-limited settings
7. **Researchers** - Studying drug interactions and safety

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >95% precision for known drug interactions
- **Performance**: <3 second response time for interaction checks
- **Coverage**: Support for 10,000+ medications globally
- **Accessibility**: 99.9% uptime with global CDN distribution
- **Impact**: Measurable reduction in preventable adverse drug events

2. WHEN showing side effects THEN the system SHALL categorize them as immediate (hours), short-term (days-weeks), and long-term (months-years)
3. WHEN multiple drugs are selected THEN the system SHALL highlight overlapping side effects that may be amplified
4. IF side effects require monitoring THEN the system SHALL suggest specific tests or symptoms to watch for

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare system administrator, I want to integrate interaction checking into our electronic health records, so that we can automatically screen prescriptions and reduce medication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN processing batch requests THEN the system SHALL handle up to 1000 drug combinations per minute
3. WHEN integrating with EHR systems THEN the system SHALL support HL7 FHIR medication resources
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with retry guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher studying drug interactions, I want access to interaction data and prediction confidence scores, so that I can validate findings and contribute to improving interaction detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing predictions THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores based on evidence strength
2. WHEN interactions are predicted by AI models THEN the system SHALL distinguish between known and predicted interactions
3. WHEN accessing research features THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable interaction matrices and statistics
4. IF new interaction evidence is submitted THEN the system SHALL have a process for community validation and integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a global health worker in resource-limited settings, I want support for generic drug names and international variations, so that I can check interactions with local medication names and common drug variations.
