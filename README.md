# AI-Powered Drug-Drug Interaction Checker

**Created by:** Govind and Ermanno  
**Project Type:** AI Hackathon - Drug Discovery Application  
**Repository:** https://github.com/elngovind/drug-discovery  

## Overview

A comprehensive AI-powered platform that prevents dangerous drug interactions by providing real-time safety assessments, side effect information, and alternative medication suggestions. Built with AWS serverless architecture and advanced machine learning capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Interaction Checking**: Instant analysis of drug combinations with severity classifications
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Natural language processing for personalized medical explanations
- **Comprehensive Side Effects**: Short-term and long-term effect information with monitoring guidance
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Safer medication alternatives when interactions are detected
- **Global Accessibility**: Multi-language support and international drug name recognition
- **Healthcare Integration**: API endpoints for EHR systems and mobile applications

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Type-safe server-side development
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for auto-scaling
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Fast NoSQL database for drug interactions
- **Amazon Bedrock**: LLM integration for natural language processing
- **AWS Comprehend Medical**: Medical entity extraction

### Infrastructure
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Amazon API Gateway**: RESTful API management
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Global content delivery
- **Amazon S3**: Data storage and static assets

### Frontend (Coming Soon)
- **React.js**: Responsive web application
- **Progressive Web App**: Mobile-optimized experience
