## Daily Sync Schedule

### Daily Standup (15 minutes)
- **Time**: 9:00 AM (adjust to your timezone)
- **Format**: 
  - What did you complete yesterday?
  - What will you work on today?
  - Any blockers or dependencies?

### Integration Points
- **End of Day 1**: API contracts defined
- **End of Day 2**: Backend APIs ready for frontend integration
- **End of Day 3**: Full integration testing
- **Day 4**: Demo polish and presentation prep

## Communication Channels

### Primary: GitHub Issues
- Create issues for each task
- Use labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `ai`, `bug`, `enhancement`
- Assign issues to team members
- Comment on progress and blockers

### Secondary: Quick Updates
- Use commit messages for progress updates
- Tag each other in pull requests
- Use GitHub Discussions for design decisions

## Code Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(api): add drug interaction endpoint
fix(frontend): resolve search component bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create PR with description and screenshots
4. Request review from teammate
5. Merge after approval

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

## Integration Testing

### API Contract Testing
- Use Postman collections for API testing
- Share environment variables securely
- Test all endpoints before frontend integration

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify AI responses are appropriate
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Validate error handling

## Demo Preparation

### Demo Script Structure
1. **Problem Statement** (30 seconds)
2. **Solution Overview** (1 minute)
3. **Live Demo** (3 minutes)
   - Natural language query
   - Interaction detection
   - AI explanation
   - Alternative suggestions
4. **Technical Innovation** (1 minute)
5. **Global Impact** (30 seconds)

### Demo Data Preparation
- Prepare 5-10 common drug combinations
- Include examples of different severity levels
- Test AI explanations for clarity
- Prepare backup scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Merge Conflicts**: Communicate before working on same files
- **API Changes**: Update contracts in shared documentation
- **Environment Issues**: Use Docker for consistent development
- **AWS Limits**: Monitor usage and set up alerts

### Emergency Contacts
- **Govind**: [Your contact info]
- **Ermanno**: [Ermanno's contact info]
- **Backup Communication**: [Alternative method]

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- [ ] All 21 tasks completed
- [ ] >90% test coverage
- [ ] <3 second API response times
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] AI explanations working

### Hackathon Goals
